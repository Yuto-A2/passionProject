I made a diary application to learn a language.

There are three tables, which are teacher, student, diary of.

The diary table is a bridge connecting to a student table and teacher table.

Students can write and rewrite their diaries, also teachers can edit their contents and give a comment.

One of the difficult part is setting a right route/path.

WHen I make lists of the tables, it did not show up. 

I searched up a lot, but it really takes a lot of time.

Finally, I thought I can set route and pass to the data.

The lists show up.

I made it.
